# LED_Matrix_RP2040
Hardware module for abstracting LED matrix interface. Raw data is sent over an IO bus which is then replayed to the LED matrix repeatedly. Application logic is responsible for producing raw data and generating synchronization signal.

## Status
This code base is a work in progress. See [this](https://github.com/daveythacher/LED_Matrix_RP2040/blob/main/LED_Matrix/README.md#status) for more details.

This code basis will likely be abandoned due to integrity issues. Most LED Matrix libraries have issues with integrity. I have been on an adventure trying to improve the quality of LED Matrix displays, which is quite poor in my opinion. Only some of my findings have been documented and at some point I will just have to be comfortable with the journey's merit. (I trust my verbage finds you even better.) My personal growth from this has been a unique perspective on reality, which was certainly worth my time.

Roadblock: [Issue Number 61](https://github.com/daveythacher/LED_Matrix_RP2040/issues/61)

I assume no liability in any way as a result of this code base. This code base is [licensed under GPL 3](https://github.com/daveythacher/LED_Matrix_RP2040/blob/main/LICENSE).
