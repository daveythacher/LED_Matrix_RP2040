12 bits per color:
			95.3		3000	
Max columns for GEN 3: 	1024 (1S)	1024 (1S)
Max columns for GEN 2: 	512 (1S) 	64 (1S)	
Max columns for GEN 1: 	32 (1S)		1 (1S)

RP2040 can only support a column of 8 or 16 for GEN 1.
	In order to support 16 the max memory limit is used (96KB) over a fast serial algorithm (>25Mbps).
	In order to support 8, nearly the max CPU limit is used. (Remote processing is also available.)
GEN 3 significantly out performs GEN 2 in pixel density with max grayscale when using max refresh.
GEN 2 significantly out performs GEN 1 in pixel density.
Fan out limits GEN 3 and GEN 2 below max refresh.
Fan out limits GEN 3 at max refresh.
