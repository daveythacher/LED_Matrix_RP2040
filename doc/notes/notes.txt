Max color depth of 12 bits and pixel density per chain for GEN 1 is 32 columns. Making max pixel density 64-1024 pixels.
For 8192 pixels would mean a PWM bitplane buffer of 2MB (including double buffering). (8 channels)
Max RAM per channel is 256KB.

Max color depth of 12 bits and pixel density per chain for GEN 2 is 32 columns. Making max pixel density 64-16384 pixels.
For 131072 pixels would mean a bitplane buffer of 2MB (including double buffering). (8 channels)
Max RAM per channel is 256KB.

Max color depth of 12 bits and pixel density per chain for GEN 3 is 128 columns. Making max pixel density 256-8192 pixels.
For 65536 pixels would mean a bitplane buffer of 1MB (including double buffering). (8 channels)
Max RAM per channel is 128KB.
Concerns exist for GEN 3 with clock signal(s) capacitive load which limit the GEN 3 scaling in chain length.
 A repeater could address these concerns, which would allow the scaling to move beyond 8 times.

Flicker free reduces pixel density in GEN 2. (It has not effect in GEN 3.)
Pixel density becomes 64-512 pixels. (Bitplane buffer is 64KB including double buffering for 8 channels.)

Flicker free reduces color depth or pixel density in GEN 1. (It has no effect in GEN 3.)
Flicker free reduces color depth to 7-bits with 32 columns. Making max pixel density 64-1024 pixels.
For 8192 pixels would mean a max PWM bitplane buffer would be 128KB (including double buffering). (8 channels)
Max RAM per channel is 16KB. (32KB for dual)

I think we should only consider flicker free designs.
	Max panel is 32x32 for GEN 1 PWM (using 3-bits).
		Not factoring in dot correction or light polution.
	Max panel is 16x32 for GEN 2 PWM (using 9-bits).
		Not factoring in dot correction or light polution.
	Max panel is 64x128 for GEN 3 PWM (using 7-bits).
		Not factoring in dot correction or light polution.
	Max panel is 64x128 for ON/OF. (GEN 1)

Using dot correction would lower the PWM bit count even lower.

Outdoor panels have higher PWM bit count but lower pixel density per chain.
	Indoor panels benefit the most from GEN 3. (These are less common.)
		They can only be so bright so PWM bit is constrained by density (multiplex/cost) and contrast.

PoE display has the potential to work on GEN 1 since the max PWM bits is limited.
	Multiplex lower contrast by factor of 8.
	Power lowers contrast by factor of 4.
	Distance/Light polution lowers contrast by factor of 16.
	GEN 1 has enough serial bandwidth for 4 PWM bits, while the LEDs are likely only capable of 3 PWM bits.
