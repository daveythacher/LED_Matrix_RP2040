This is just a little note to self.

In the future adding support for hardware PWM drivers can be done using the BCM nibble notion. This wastes some memory but we are not worried about that. Max size for GEN 3 is 32x64 which is smaller than 64x128 potential. Max size for GEN 2 is the same as GEN 1: 16x32. (I am assuming 3kHz refresh as requirement.)
