# Test Documentation
This implements the Test Serial Algorithm for testing Matrix Algorithms.

## Status
This is believed to be in working order, however testing did not cover all aspects.

## Overview
This will generate test RGB frames for Matrix algorithms.

Note testing of worker should be performed off device. These are pure computation which can be simulated in any C/C++ environment.

## Interrupts
Follows standard design for Serial Algorithms. (Not used.)

## Core reservations
Follows standard design for Serial Algorithms. (Uses idle loop.)
