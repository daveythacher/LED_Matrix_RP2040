# Test Documentation
This implements the Test Matrix Algorithm for testing Serial Algorithms.

## Status
This is believed to be in working order, however testing did not cover all aspects.

## Overview
This will output the provided RGB data from the Serial Algorithm to UART 1.

## Interrupts
Follows standard design for Matrix Algorithms.

## Core reservations
Follows standard design for Matrix Algorithms.
