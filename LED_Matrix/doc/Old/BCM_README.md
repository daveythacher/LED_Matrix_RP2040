# BCM Documentation
This implements the BCM Matrix Algorithm for standard (GEN 1) LED Panels. This does not use standard PWM.

BCM stands for binary coded modulation, which uses the binary magnitude to express the duty cycle.

Cool log(n) trick. Can be accelerated using 4-bit LUT in a modular form.

## Status
Discontinued.
