## ISR folder
This contains the top level interface for ISR logic. Currently this is just stub to be called by main.

## Matrix folder
This contains the top level interface for Matrix algorithms. It also contains the structures and configuration specifications for different Matrix algorithms.

## Multiplex folder
This contains the top level interface for Multiplex algorithms. Currently this is just a stub to be called by Matrix algorithms.

## Serial folder
This contains the top level interface for Serial algorithms. Currently this is just a standard collection of stubs for each algorithm called by the Serial algorithm and by main.
